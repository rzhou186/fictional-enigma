    <div>It’s been an eternity since I was born, manufactured, stuffed. I thought I might be stuck in this warehouse forever.</div>
    <div>But today the impossible has happened - I’m heading to a new home.</div>
    <div>Some overseas student, the broker told me. Not for him, but a girl he would do anything for. American. Studying abroad. Homesick. She apparently has insomnia or something, and needs my help. He told me he couldn’t bear thinking of her like that.</div>
    <div>Who am I?</div>
